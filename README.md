HELLO! 

I'm not sure if someone will read this, probably not. But either way, I'll write a few things about me in here.
So, my name is Carlos Castor, and I'm working as a software engineer for over six years. In those years, I've been working mainly with Java, but I  enjoy taking a look at other things.
That's all for now. As things go on, I'll update here.
